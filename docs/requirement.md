## Implementation Phase

Based on the project structure and the implementation roadmap from requirements.md, here's where we stand:

Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure âœ“ (Partially Complete)

- [x] PostgreSQL container setup (docker-compose-dev.yml exists)
- [x] Basic project structure setup (NestJS structure is in place)
- [x] Environment configuration (.gitignore suggests .env usage)
- [x] API Documentation Setup (OpenAPI/Swagger)

Phase 2: Database Design & Setup ðŸš§ (In Progress)

- [ ] Database migrations implementation (Started with users table)
- [ ] Knex query builder setup (knexfile.ts exists)
- [ ] Most of the required tables still need to be created

Phase 3: Authentication & Authorization ðŸš§ (Early Stages)

- [ ] Started users module implementation
- [ ] Most authentication features
- [ ] Two-Factor Authentication
- [ ] Role-based authorization

Phases 4-7: Not Started Yet

- Core Modules Implementation (Savings, Loans, etc.)
- Integration & Features
- Testing & Security
- Documentation & Deployment

Summary of Current State:
The project is in its early stages, primarily in Phase 1 and beginning of Phase 2
Basic infrastructure is set up with:
NestJS framework
PostgreSQL database configuration
Basic project structure
Initial database migration setup
Next immediate steps should be:
Complete the database migrations for all required tables
Implement the authentication system
Set up API documentation with Swagger
Begin implementing core modules (Members, Savings, Loans)
